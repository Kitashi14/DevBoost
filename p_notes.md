1. Logs should be more detailed and contextual. Should contain terminal information and dir in which it was ran.
2. Log cleanup should be taken care as it is fed as context to AI.
3. Command ran by the extension should be at the correct directory. 
4. When saving/creating buttons, should ask confirmation for ai generated descriptions. 
5. Spike: Prompt enhancer button positioning in vs code.
6. Make project modular and production level. (Use LLD)
7. Make script files using our log history. And generate button for them.


Future:
